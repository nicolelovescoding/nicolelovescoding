- 👀 I’m interested in books, music, art, fashion, nature treks, swimming and dancing.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to code through Dr. Angela Yu's web development bootcamp on Udemy.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with like-minded individuals, ideally people who are similarly learning to code for the first time.
- 📫 You can reach out to me here if there's a chat feature on github.
- 😄 Pronouns: she/her
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm scared to death about my career switch from social media marketing to web development.
